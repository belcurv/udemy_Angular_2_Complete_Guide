# Udemy - Angular 2 The Complete Guide

## Section 1: Getting Started

**Install Angular CLI via NPM:**

`sudo npm install -g @angular/cli`

**Creating a new project**

`ng new {name of your new project}`

> Holy shit - it takes _forever_ to generate a new app.

Once the new app is finshed installing, start the server to make sure it all worked:

`ng serve`

That bundles the app using Webpack and starts a local server running on port 4200 (localhost:4200). This takes a while too.

**Editing our new project**

We can ignore most of the files/folders generated by `angular-cli`. We will work primarily in the `/src` folder.

`index.html` serves our SPA. We don't need to edit it at all - we'll work in `/src/app`.

**app.component.ts**
We build our Angular applications out of components.  The `app.component` is the one component we define that loads on initialpage load.

**ngModel is ... different**


`app.component.ts` looks like this:

```
    import { Component } from '@angular/core';

    @Component({
        selector: 'app-root',
        templateUrl: './app.component.html',
        styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
    })
    export class AppComponent {
        name = '';
    }
```

See the `export class Appcomponent` bit? the `name` property (variable?) in there is bound to the view (like $scope does in Angular 1).  Then, in `app.component.html` we do:

```
    <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="name">
    <p>{{ name }}</p>
```

The new view syntax for ngModel = `[(ngModel)]="bound-variable"`

**What hasn't changed?**

1.  Templates, DataBinding and Directives still exist.
2.  Services and Dependency still exist.
3.  Routing is still a thing.
4.  Pipes (for transforming template output) still exist

**What's new?**

1.  Observables

### Decorators

Decorators make Angular 2 components _components_. Without them, they're nothing.

All components need exactly 1 template. Template is controlled by the TS code in our class.

```
@Component({
    selector: 'app-root',  // our new html element
    templateUrl: './app-root.component.html',  // our template file 
    styleUrls: []          // this component's css
})
```

`/src/main.ts` is run first and bootstraps our main module, AppComponent.
