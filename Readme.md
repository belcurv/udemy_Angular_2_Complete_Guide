## Udemy - Angular 2 The Complete Guide

### Section 1: Getting Started

**Install Angular CLI via NPM:**

`sudo npm install -g @angular/cli`

**Creating a new project**

`ng new {name of your new project}`

> Holy shit - it takes _forever_ to generate a new app.

Once the new app is finshed installing, start the server to make sure it all worked:

`ng serve`

That bundles the app using Webpack and starts a local server running on port 4200 (localhost:4200). This takes a while too.

**Editing our new project**

We can ignore most of the files/folders generated by `angular-cli`. We will work primarily in the `/src` folder.

`index.html` serves our SPA. We don't need to edit it at all - we'll work in `/src/app`.

**app.component.ts**
We build our Angular applications out of components.  The `app.component` is the one component we define that loads on initialpage load.

**ngModel is ... different**


`app.component.ts` looks like this:

```javascript
    import { Component } from '@angular/core';

    @Component({
        selector: 'app-root',
        templateUrl: './app.component.html',
        styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
    })
    export class AppComponent {
        name = '';
    }
```

See the `export class Appcomponent` bit? the `name` property (variable?) in there is bound to the view (like $scope does in Angular 1).  Then, in `app.component.html` we do:

```
    <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="name">
    <p>{{ name }}</p>
```

The new view syntax for ngModel = `[(ngModel)]="bound-variable"`

**What hasn't changed?**

1.  Templates, DataBinding and Directives still exist.
2.  Services and Dependency still exist.
3.  Routing is still a thing.
4.  Pipes (for transforming template output) still exist

**What's new?**

1.  Observables

**Decorators**

Decorators make Angular 2 components _components_. Without them, they're nothing.

All components need exactly 1 template. Template is controlled by the TS code in our class.

```javascript
    @Component({
        selector: 'app-root',  // our new html element
        templateUrl: './app-root.component.html',  // our template file 
        styleUrls: []          // this component's css
})
```

**TypeScript**

More features than vanilla JS (e.g. Types, Classes, Interfaces, ...).

**Boostrapping**

`/src/main.ts` is run first and bootstraps our main module, AppModule: 

```javascript
    import { enableProdMode } from '@angular/core';
    import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';

    import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';
    import { environment } from './environments/environment';

    if (environment.production) {
      enableProdMode();
    }

    platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule);
```

In the last line, the `bootstrapModule()` method is passed one argument: the `AppModule` imported in the 4th line from `./app/app.module.ts`.

Looking at `app.module.ts`, notice the `bootstrap: [AppComponent]` array in the decorator - this is where the circle closes: we reference our appComponent (`./app/app.component.ts`).

So it all works like this:

1.  `main.ts` loads first bootstrapping our main application, passing our `app.module.ts` module as an argument
2.  in `app.module.ts` we tell Angular to bootstrap our `appComponent` component.
3.  Angular loads `appComponent` which references a `app-root` selector, and 
4.  now Angular can handle `app-root` in `index.html`, inserting `appComponent` in place of the directive.

#### Components

Key feature. We'll compose the whole application from components we'll create.

We start with our appComponent - the root component. On one hand it's a normal Angular component; on the other hand it's special because it's our root component.  We'll later add additional components to this one. Their selectors will not be added to our `index.html` file; instead they'll be added to `app/app.component.html`.

**A component is a TypsScript class**. Angular is able to instantiate it - to create objects based on this "blueprint".

When making our own components, we'll begin by naming and exporting it (because we need to _import_ it elsewhere):

```javascript
    export class ServerComponent {

    }
```

That's a normal TypeScript class, named "ServerComponent". But it doesn't do anything - it needs more information: a **decorator** tells Angular this is a component. We'll use the Component decorator, which we need to import before we can use:

```javascript
    import { Component } from '@angular/core'    // import Component from Angular core

    @Component({                                 // init Component, which takes a config object
        selector: 'app-server',                  // html element
        templateUrl: './server.component.html'   // template
    })
    export class ServerComponent {

    }
```

Before we can use this component, we need to update our `app.module.ts`. Angular uses components to build we pages, and uses modules to bundle pieces (components, etc) into packages. What does `appModule` do? It's a collection of our app's features. We need to register our new `app-server` component in `appModule` before we can use it. Add an `import` statement and include the component's name in the `declarations` property of NgModule's config object:

```javascript
    import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
    import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
    import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
    import { HttpModule } from '@angular/http';

    import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
    import { ServerComponent } from './server/server.component';

    @NgModule({
        declarations: [
            AppComponent,
            ServerComponent
        ],
        imports: [
            BrowserModule,
            FormsModule,
            HttpModule
        ],
        providers: [],
        bootstrap: [AppComponent]
    })
    export class AppModule { }
```

We can also create components with the CLI. Say we wanted our `app-server` component nested inside a `servers` component.

```
    ng generate component servers
```

(shorthand for the same)

```
    ng g c servers
```

The `generate` command creates all the files we need, namsepaced the proper way ('servers.component.ts'), in a folder named 'servers', AND updates `app.module.ts`.

**Inline Templates**

Components like `servers.component.ts` **need** to reference a template (just like Angular 1 directives). There are times when you can omit the selector, and you don't need to have styles - but **templates have to be present**.

The template can be either and external file or inline, and the sytax is the same as Angular 1: `template` vs `templateUrl`. We could re-write our `servers.component.ts` like this:

```
    import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

    @Component({
      selector: 'app-servers',
      template: '<app-server></app-server><app-server></app-server>',
      styleUrls: ['./servers.component.css']
    })
    export class ServersComponent implements OnInit {

      constructor() { }

      ngOnInit() {
      }

    }
```

**Styling**

You can have only 1 template; you can have multiple stylesheets.

Since we are loading Bootstrap, we can just add CSS classes to the HTML in our templates:

```html
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12">
                <h3>I'm in the App Component</h3>
                <hr>
                <app-servers></app-servers>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
```

But we also have this line in our `app.component.ts` @Component decorator:

```
    styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
```

That is an array of separate external stylesheets, all of which get applied to this component only. Edit `app.component.css` just like you would any normal CSS file.

You can also write _inline_ CSS using a `styles` property which takes an array of strings:

```
    import { Component } from '@angular/core';

    @Component({
      selector: 'app-root',
      templateUrl: './app.component.html',
      // styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
      styles: [`
        h3 {
            color: dodgerblue;
        }
      `]
    })
    export class AppComponent {

    }
```

**Selectors**

Just like in CSS, our Angular selectors can reference different DOM things. In our component.ts files, we can select by any of the following:

1.  an element:
    `selector: 'app-servers'`
2.  an element's attribute:
    `selector: '[app-servers]'`
3.  an elements class:
    `selector: '.app-servers'`

**BUT** selecting by ID will **NOT** work.

### Assignment 1
1.  Create 2 new components, one manually and one using the CLI: WarningAlter and SuccessAlert
2.  Output them beneath each other
3.  make sure they have some appropriate text
4.  Style the components appropriately, one inline and one w/external stylesheet
